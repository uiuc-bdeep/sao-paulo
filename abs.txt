    A growing literature seeks to evaluate the resilience of transportation
    infrastructure in developing country cities and to target investments in
    infrastructure improvements. Much of this literature focuses on improved
    design, materials, and costs of resilient infrastructure, but relatively
    little is known about the economic benefits associated with reducing the
    impacts of weather events in a transportation system. This study
    presents some of the first estimates of the economic benefits associated
    with travel delays due to flood events in a developing country city. Our
    empirical strategy makes use of repeat observations of trip durations
    from google’s traffic API to separately identify the general effects of
    precipitation events and the specific effects of delays that result
    specifically from infrastructure flooding. Our results suggest that the
    total economic effect of flood-induced travel delays in the city of Sao
    Paulo is 455 million BRL per year, which is roughly 9.6% of the city’s
    GDP.
